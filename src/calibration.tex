The dielectric constants of water and alcohol are not always constant, instead they depend on pressure and temperature.
The sensor system does not have a way to detect those and it is necessary to manually enter the approximate temperature and pressure of the liquid to get better results.

A good starting point would be to measure samples of pure water and pure ethanol in order to obtain a baseline for the results (like an upper and lower limit of the expected values).
After that, we can start with measuring different mixture ratios, and verify that the calculations are correct.
