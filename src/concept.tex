The goal is to make a sensor that measures alcohol concentration in a liquid.
Water and alcohol have different physical attributes, and by measuring the liquid's properties we can determine what mixture of water to alcohol it contains.
The sensor system will work on the principle of observing the behaviour of radio waves which pass through the mixture.
